Sidebar Navigation: The sidebar includes icons for Home, Explore, Subscriptions, and Library, similar to YouTube's navigation menu.
Header: The header contains the YouTube logo, a search bar with a search button, a microphone icon, and icons for video upload, notifications, and user profile.
Tags Bar: A bar below the header allows users to filter content by different categories like All, Mixes, Crypto, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Video Cards: The main section displays video cards with thumbnails, channel avatars, video titles, channel names, view counts, and upload dates.

HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
CSS: For styling and layout, using Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.
Icons and Images: Used SVGs for icons and PNGs for images to replicate the YouTube UI.
Layout and Design
The layout uses Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
A consistent color scheme and typography inspired by YouTube to provide a familiar user experience.
Hover effects and transitions for interactive elements to enhance user interaction.

Sidebar Navigation: Click on the icons in the sidebar to navigate to different sections.
Search: Use the search bar in the header to search for videos (Note: This is a static front-end, so the search functionality is not implemented).
Video Cards: Browse through the video cards in the main section to view video details.
This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to build a static replica of a complex web application like YouTube, focusing on layout, design, and responsiveness.
